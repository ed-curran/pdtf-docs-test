Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.


import {PdtfTryIt} from "../../../components/api.jsx";

here is a json schema

import { JsonSchemaViewer } from "@stoplight/json-schema-viewer";
import * as userSchema from "/public/userSchema.json"

<JsonSchemaViewer client:only
    name="User Schema"
    schema={userSchema}
    expanded={false}
    hideTopBar={false}
    emptyText="No schema defined"
    defaultExpandedDepth={0}
/>

here is an interactive api call
<br/>
<PdtfTryIt client:only/>
